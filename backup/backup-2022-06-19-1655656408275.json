VinFast has hinted at other similar partnerships to be revealed in the future.</p>\n<p>VinFast’s battery leasing model involves selling its vehicles — the VF 8, a five-passenger midsize SUV, and the VF 9, a seven-passenger SUV — without the battery pack included in the price. Customers can instead lease the battery for a monthly fee that will be based on how many miles they drive. This model might help make its vehicles more accessible, the company contends.</p>\n<p>It also has the potential to extend the lifecycle of the vehicle itself. Taiwanese company Gogoro, which <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/05/gogoros-public-debut-could-supercharge-ev-battery-swapping-across-the-globe/\" target=\"_self\">has recently gone public via a special purpose acquisition merger</a>, has popularized its electric motorcycle and moped battery swapping ecosystem in Taiwan in large part due to the ease factor of swapping a battery rather than waiting for it to charge. However, batteries are often the first components of a vehicle to die, so being able to simply replace it, rather than the whole car, can keep vehicles on the roads longer.</p>\n<p>However, it’s not clear whether adding this layer into the VinFast equation will make the whole process just that much more confusing for EV buyers, especially if they’re in a region where it’s difficult to trade in a battery, although VinFast is planning <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/19/vietnamese-carmaker-vinfast-plots-course-for-us-market-starting-with-two-electric-crossovers/\" target=\"_self\">to open at least 60 stores across the U.S.</a></p>\n<p>The scheme is made potentially more complicated because VinFast says that by the end of 2023, 50% of the battery will be for rent while the rest is for sale along with the purchase of the car. VinFast did not respond in time to requests for clarification.</p>\n<p>The VF 8 will cost anywhere from $40,700 to $48,000 depending on trim and battery pack, the company said on Wednesday, updating previous numbers shared at CES in January. The VF 8 Eco version battery can go up to 292 miles on a full charge and the Plus version can go up to 277 miles.</p>\n<p>The VF 9 has a price range of $55,500 to $61,000. The Eco version of its battery has a top range of 369 miles, and the Plus version can go up to 360 miles, VinFast said.</p>\n<p>It’s not yet clear whether the vehicle prices will be different should a customer choose to go the battery leasing route.</p>\n<p>VinFast is offering a flexible plan of $35 per month for the VF 8 and $44 for the VF 9 for drivers who can stick to 310 miles of use each month. Going over the 310 miles will incur a charge of 11 cents and 15 cents per extra mile for the VF 8 and VF 9, respectively.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/ohim/onh00/bar8.htm\" target=\"_self\">data</a> from the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Highway Administration, the average person drives over 1,000 miles every month.</p>\n<p>So for the average American driver, the fixed lease plan might be a better option. For $110 per month and $160 per month for the VF 8 and VF 9, respectively, customers can have unlimited miles. VinFast is currently freezing the monthly cost of the fixed plan over the vehicle’s lifetime in order to encourage new orders, the company said.</p>\n<p>“By separating the price of the battery from the acquisition value of the automobile, VinFast takes on all the risks related to the vehicle’s battery and ensures a reasonable price for its products, while providing customers with peace of mind about the battery’s quality during use,” the company said in a statement.</p>\n<p>VinFast said it would provide a lifetime battery warranty that covers all maintenance and repair costs of the battery, and will replace the battery for free when charging capacity dips below 70%.</p>\n<p>At the Auto Show, VinFast also activated its VinFirst NFT exchange on Open Sea. The automaker is using blockchain technology to record orders and confirm ownership as part of a global reservation program that began in January. When customers make a deposit for their reservation, they’ll receive an NFT on VinFast’s platform.</p>\n","PostTitle":"Can VinFast make EV battery subscriptions a thing?","MetaDescription":null,"Description":"At the New York International Auto Show on Wednesday, Vietnamese automaker VinFast revealed battery subscription prices for the two electric SUVs it aims to sell in the U.S. market by the end of the year.","Published":"active","AuthorInfo":{"PK":"ACCT_ujygf9hil43mstls","AccountId":"ujygf9hil43mstls","Avatar":"1655580367367business-man.png","FullName":"Administrator"},"Tags":[{"TagName":"Vinfast","UpdatedDate":"2022-06-19 19:53:58","TagId":"tjygfjqcl4lb8ilq","SK":"TAG_tjygfjqcl4lb8ilq","CreatedDate":"2022-06-19 19:53:58","PK":"ACCT_ujygf9hil43mstls","Thumbnail":"1655643238174logo-vinfast-inkythuatso-21-11-08-55.jpeg"},{"TagName":"Electric Car","UpdatedDate":"2022-06-19 19:53:22","CreatedDate":"2022-06-19 19:53:22","TagId":"tjygfjqcl4lb7qyo","SK":"TAG_tjygfjqcl4lb7qyo","PK":"ACCT_ujygf9hil43mstls","Thumbnail":"1655643202344front-left-side-47.webp"}],"MetaKeyword":null,"UpdatedDate":"2022-06-19 19:56:55","CreatedDate":"2022-06-19 19:56:07","SK":"POST_pjygfjqcl4lbban0","PK":"ACCT_ujygf9hil43mstls","ReadingTime":"9","PostImage":"1655643415472Screen Shot 2022-06-19 at 19.56.39.png","PublishedDate":"Jul 19 2022"},{"Categories":[{"CategoryId":"cjygfjqcl4lbkkki","UpdatedDate":"2022-06-19 20:03:20","SK":"CAT_cjygfjqcl4lbkkki","CreatedDate":"2022-06-19 20:03:20","CategoryName":"Smartphones","PK":"ACCT_ujygf9hil43mstls","Thumbnail":"1655643800594smartphone-o-viet-nam_800x450.jpeg"}],"PostID":"pjygfjqcl4lbnmcx","Thumbnail":"1655643942741Screen Shot 2022-06-19 at 20.05.01.png","Content":"<p>A new startup called <a href=\"https://grace-app.com/\" target=\"_self\">Grace</a> is launching to make it easier for parents to monitor and manage their kids’ screen time and app usage on iOS devices. Although Apple offers built-in parental controls, many parents would prefer an app-based solution as opposed to having to dig around in the settings for Apple’s tools. In addition, Grace offers more customization over kids’ screen time schedules. With Apple’s controls, parents can only configure start and stop times for “Downtime,” for instance, as opposed to being able to set other times when app usage should be limited, like school hours, family dinner time, homework time and more.</p>\n<p>Grace is also notable for being one of the first to arrive that’s built with Apple’s Screen Time API, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-finally-launches-a-screen-time-api-for-app-developers/\" target=\"_self\">introduced</a> at Apple’s Worldwide Developer Conference last year. The new API allows developers to create an interface that works with Apple’s built-in tools in order to expand their functionality.</p>\n<p>To use Grace, parents install the app on both their own devices and their kids’ iPhones or iPads. They can then configure a variety of screen time controls remotely in an intuitive interface, including things like daily screen time limits, app time limits, limits on in-app purchases and can block time-wasting apps, among other things. Helpfully, they can also create screen time schedules that better reflect a family’s own rules about how and when kids should be using their devices.</p>\n<img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/SCREEEN-TIME.png?w=314\" alt=\"undefined\" style=\"height: undefined;width: undefined\"/>\n<p></p>\n<p>For example, if you want to block TikTok and Snapchat at bedtime as well as during school hours, there’s no way to do this today using only Apple’s own tools. Instead, Apple’s Screen Time controls let parents set time-based app limits, or “Downtime” — a time when kids can only use parent-approved apps and communicate with those you’ve permitted, like mom or dad, via phone calls and texts. In practice, this translates to parents configuring Downtime to begin at bedtime and extend through the night to limit kids from staying up late on their devices, or they may choose to enable it only during the school day. Either way, this solution is not fully meeting the family’s needs.</p>\n<p>Grace, meanwhile, lets parents create all different types of schedules for their children, not just one Downtime schedule. That means parents can limit screen time for different types of apps at various times. At school, kids could be allowed to access educational apps and the web browser but not entertainment apps, social media or games, perhaps. During family dinner, all distractions could be set to off. Parents may also want to configure other screen time schedules related to their own family rules, like bedtime routines, screen-free weekends, vacations or anything else they choose.</p>\n<img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/SCHEDULES.png?w=314\" alt=\"undefined\" style=\"height: undefined;width: undefined\"/>\n<p></p>\n<p>Another benefit to Grace is that it offers enhanced website blocking with built-in filters than automatically block over 50,000 adult, gambling, weapon, alcohol and drug-related websites, and this list is updated regularly. Apple’s own Screen Time tools only focus on blocking adult sites.</p>\n<p>Grace also adds quick action buttons that let parents pause restrictions (“Pause”) or block all apps (“Lock phone”), without having to disable the Screen Time settings entirely. Any parent who uses Apple’s Screen Time will understand the benefit here. Often, families are in a position where the usual rules are paused — like when the child is staying up late at a sleepover party, when it’s a school holiday, when they’re home sick or when they’ve earned extra screen time through some sort of allowance system, among other things. But at other times, parents may want to ground a child by limiting access to their device — but don’t actually want to have to take the phone away, since it’s also a way for them to communicate in the event of an emergency. Locking them out of all apps, however, would work to serve as the punishment.</p>\n<img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/LOCK_PAUSE.png?w=314\" alt=\"undefined\" style=\"height: undefined;width: undefined\"/>\n<p></p>\n<p>Grace’s app was created by co-founders, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/liana-khanova/\" target=\"_self\">Liana Khanova</a> (Product and Design) and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ikhanov/?originalSubdomain=ru\" target=\"_self\">Salavat Khanov</a> (Software Development), who both bring relevant experience to their new project. Khanova previously worked on her startup focused on reducing children’s phone addiction by having them engage with interactive kids’ books that used AR. Khanov had worked on ad blocker and privacy tool 1Blocker. They note that their new app is bootstrapped and fully independent.</p>\n<p>The team hopes that Apple will update the API to allow them to be even more competitive with the built-in screen time tools. They said the API today lacks the ability to show users how much time they have left and how much time they’ve used. They’d also love to see an improved app picker available — like the one Apple offers that has a search field. And they would like the API to include the ability to set communication limits, as well, as Apple’s own tools can.</p>\n<p>“Despite all of these limitations, I still think this solution is better for parental controls compared to MDM-based apps,” said Khanova as to why Grace is a better option over existing apps that used MDM solutions, an early workaround for lack of API access used by third-party screen time tools. “[MDM apps’] servers might get hacked and sensitive data leaked — like your child’s phone number, visited sites, search requests, installed apps, etc. The attacker could also remotely erase the device,” she said. Plus, “these companies may collect a ton of data and sell it to advertisers,” Khanova warned.</p>\n<img src=\"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/BLOCK-APPS-SITES.png?w=314\" alt=\"undefined\" style=\"height: undefined;width: undefined\"/>\n<p></p>\n<p>Screen time management tools for iOS have had a complicated history.</p>\n<p>Shortly after the release of iOS 12 in 2018, Apple <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/17/ios-12-is-now-available-to-download/\" target=\"_self\">rolled out its</a> own built-in screen time tracking tools and controls. But the tech giant then began a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/05/apple-puts-third-party-screen-time-apps-on-notice/\" target=\"_self\">widespread crackdown</a> on third-party apps that had implemented their own screen time systems, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/28/apple-defends-its-takedown-of-some-apps-monitoring-screen-time/\" target=\"_self\">saying these apps had done so</a> in a way that risked user privacy. The earlier apps had come up with creative solutions to solve users’ needs for parental controls — like using VPNs or mobile device management (MDM) technologies — the latter of which had been designed for enterprise use, not consumer-facing apps. MDM-based tools could access a device’s location, control app usage and set various permissions — all of which make sense in terms of locking down employee devices. But Apple argued the same tools were a risk to children’s privacy. While it was correct, it also acted unfairly to immediately block these businesses from continuing to operate the moment it had its own first-party solution available, instead of allowing them to transition to a safer solution, like an API.</p>\n<p>Not to mention, Apple had greenlit those same screen time apps and their subsequent updates for years, allowing developers to build businesses that were then destroyed by Apple’s policy changes. Apple CEO <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/29/apple-ceo-tim-cook-questioned-over-app-stores-removal-of-rival-screen-time-apps-in-antitrust-hearing/\" target=\"_self\">Tim Cook was even questioned about this decision</a> during an antitrust Congressional hearing held in July 2020, where the exec again defended the decision as related to consumer privacy.</p>\n<p>Apple’s solution was <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apple-finally-launches-a-screen-time-api-for-app-developers/\" target=\"_self\">the eventual release of a Screen Time API in 2021</a> that would allow developers to build on top of Apple’s existing features in a safe, MDM-free way. Arguably, it was the sort of technology that should have been introduced <em>alongside</em> the policy enforcement, instead of years later.</p>\n<p>Now that it’s available, however, apps like Grace can come into existence without as much threat of removal.</p>\n<p>In addition, at the recent Apple Worldwide Developer Conference, the company introduced a few new Screen Time API features, including the ability to display app and device usage data in a more privacy-preserving way, which Grace says it will use to draw charts and show activity similar to Apple’s own Screen Time system. It’s also now possible to manage screen time and restrictions not only within a parent-child relationship but for yourself — another feature Grace aims to adopt later this fall.</p>\n<p>Grace will also later rollout Lock Screen widgets to see how much screen time kids have used, new app shortcuts for quick actions and support for the Mac.</p>\n<p>Grace is currently a free download, with advanced features available through a $19.99/year subscription.</p>\n","PostTitle":"Grace debuts privacy-focused parental controls for iOS devices built with Apple’s Screen Time API","MetaDescription":null,"Description":"A new startup called Grace is launching to make it easier for parents to monitor and manage their kids’ screen time and app usage on iOS devices.","Published":"active","AuthorInfo":{"PK":"ACCT_ujygf9hil43mstls","AccountId":"ujygf9hil43mstls","Avatar":"1655580367367business-man.png","FullName":"Administrator"},"Tags":[{"TagName":"IOS","UpdatedDate":"2022-06-19 19:59:59","CreatedDate":"2022-06-19 19:59:59","TagId":"tjygfjqcl4lbg9rf","SK":"TAG_tjygfjqcl4lbg9rf","PK":"ACCT_ujygf9hil43mstls","Thumbnail":"1655643599966ios-16-og.jpeg"},{"TagName":"Apple","UpdatedDate":"2022-06-19 15:29:56","CreatedDate":"2022-06-19 15:29:41","TagId":"tjygfcijl4l1snnr","SK":"TAG_tjygfcijl4l1snnr","PK":"ACCT_ujygf9hil43mstls","Thumbnail":"1655627381689knowledge_graph_logo.png"},{"TagName":"Iphone","UpdatedDate":"2022-06-19 20:00:11","CreatedDate":"2022-06-19 20:00:11","TagId":"tjygfjqcl4lbgidu","SK":"TAG_tjygfjqcl4lbgidu","PK":"ACCT_ujygf9hil43mstls","Thumbnail":"1655643611117iphone11-select-2019-family_GEO_EMEA.jpeg"}],"MetaKeyword":null,"UpdatedDate":"2022-06-19 20:15:03","CreatedDate":"2022-06-19 20:05:42","SK":"POST_pjygfjqcl4lbnmcx","PK":"ACCT_ujygf9hil43mstls","ReadingTime":"17","PostImage":"1655643942741Screen Shot 2022-06-19 at 20.05.17.png","PublishedDate":"Jul 19 2022"},{"Categories":[],"PostID":"pjygfjqcl4lcgb59","Thumbnail":"1655645280164Screen Shot 2022-06-19 at 20.27.32.png","Content":"<p style=\"text-align:start;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(34,34,34);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Georgia, \"Times New Roman\", Times, serif;\">Hanoi Metro Company, which operates the Cat Linh-Ha Dong metro line, has reported a loss of VND54 billion ($2.32 million) since putting the line into operation in November last year.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Georgia, \"Times New Roman\", Times, serif;\">The company's accumulated loss since it began operations in 2015 is VND160 billion ($6.9 million) according to an audited financial report.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);background-color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Georgia, \"Times New Roman\", Times, serif;\">The report shows revenues of just VND5 billion after the metro line, the country's first, began commercial operations in November last year.

More than three years after <em>Endgame</em>, the MCU has yet to make clear what its plans for <em>Avengers 5</em> are – which includes a release date, a director, and <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/avengers-5-lineup-heroes-powerful-original-comparison/\" target=\"_self\">the next Avengers lineup</a>. There has never been so much time between two <em>Avengers</em> movies, which proves that <em>Avengers 5</em> is not an ordinary team-up film but rather a defining point for the future of the MCU.</p>\n<p>Initially, the <em>Avengers</em> films were meant to be the concluding chapter of each of the MCU phases. <em>The Avengers</em> saw all the heroes introduced in Phase 1 teaming up for the first time, <em>Avengers: Age of Ultron</em> dealt with the consequences of SHIELD's fall and the rising importance of the Infinity Stones in Phase 2, and the two-part story <em>Avengers: Infinity War</em> and <em>Avengers: Endgame</em> offered an epic ending to the Infinity Saga. However, that tradition seems to be lost, at least for now, as the MCU Phase 4 is set to be concluded before <em>Avengers 5</em> comes out.</p>\n<p>While the waiting for the next Avengers can only increase the expectations for the movie, it's impossible for <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/avengers-5-mcu-characters-smaller-infinity-war-endgame/\" target=\"_self\"><em>Avengers 5</em> to compete with <em>Endgame</em></a> in terms of buildup and scale – which is something Marvel seems to be aware of. It will obviously be difficult for <em>Avengers 5</em> not to be compared with <em>Endgame</em>, as the latter is the most recent <em>Avengers</em> and the second highest-grossing movie of all time, but the real challenge for <em>Avengers 5</em> is to replicate the feeling of 2012's <em>The Avengers</em>. This is the first time audiences are not sure what the Avengers lineup is going to be, and after all the deaths and retirements of the original characters in <em>Endgame</em>, <em>Avengers 5</em> is almost a new beginning for the Avengers franchise. Therefore, the movie will have to nail the choice of the new lineup, the on-screen chemistry among old and new actors, and it will have to sell that this newly formed team can work, both in-universe and to the audiences. All those challenges are something that <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/avengers-infinity-war-plot-hole-thor-dark-magic/\" target=\"_self\">the first<em> Avengers</em> movie</a> also had to deal with.</p>\n<p>Why Avengers 5 Can't Beat Endgame</p>\n<img src=\"https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Marvel-finally-explains-Avengers-endgame-mystery-.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=740&h=370&dpr=1.5\" alt=\"undefined\" style=\"height: undefined;width: undefined\"/>\n<p>Although each <em>Avengers</em> movie has been an event of its own, no other Marvel film can be compared to <em>Endgame</em> in terms of scale and stakes. Not only was <em>Endgame</em> the culmination of a decade of buildup, but the 2019 film was set to bring a resolution to the massive <em>Infinity War</em>'s snap cliffhanger, in which half of the heroes as well as half of the universe were killed by Thanos. The audiences' wish to learn if and how the snapped Avengers would return as well to witness how the final confrontation with Thanos would play out made <em>Avengers: Endgame</em> a must-see even for the more casual audiences, and thus the fourth <em>Avengers</em> film became the biggest opening weekend of all time and <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/avengers-endgame-avatar-box-office-grossing-beat-harder/\" target=\"_self\">the second highest-grossing movie only after <em>Avatar</em></a>.</p>\n<p>Replicating all those circumstances is impossible, at least for now. Only another major crossover event that brings together all corners of the MCU to fight the next big bad – be that Kang, Doom, or the Beyonder – can truly try to achieve the same levels of expectations and scale of <em>Endgame</em>. That description fits a possible Secret Wars, a storyline that is becoming more and more likely to be adapted now that Incursions have been set up in the MCU, but it does not match what <em>Avengers 5</em> needs.</p>\n<p>Avengers 5 Is A New Beginning For The Avengers</p>\n<div style=\"text-align:none;\"><img src=\"https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Avengers-5-leader-doctor-strange-sam-wilson-sersei.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=740&h=370&dpr=1.5\" alt=\"undefined\" style=\"height: undefined;width: undefined\"/></div>\n<p>While there have been some changes in the Avengers' lineup and alignments throughout the Infinity Saga, all of the <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/avengers-endgame-deaths-marvel-contracts-myth/\" target=\"_self\"><em>Avengers:</em> <em>Endgame</em>'s deaths</a> and retirements suggest that <em>Avengers 5</em> will feature the most different iteration of the team since its inception. From the original Avengers team, Iron Man and Black Widow are dead; Steve Rogers is retired, and the futures of Hawkeye, Hulk, and Thor in the franchise are still up in the air. In addition, other experienced heroes like Scarlet Witch and Doctor Strange have now their own separate, high-stakes agendas and might not ever rejoin the team, and even Spider-Man is now steered away from other heroes following the memory spell in <em>Spider-Man: No Way Home</em>.</p>\n<p>Behind the cameras, the MCU is also in a moment of transition now that some of its biggest stars are no longer part of the franchise. On top of that, the Disney+ Marvel shows have offered a new platform for the MCU, and now several new <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/knight-kate-bishop-hawkeye-break-record/\" target=\"_self\">heroes such as Kate Bishop</a>, Moon Knight, and Ms. Marvel can be introduced in a short period of time. There is no shortage of options for the next Avengers lineup, and the group will most likely be a mixture of old names, like Carol Danvers and Sam Wilson, and newer ones like Shang-chi, Monica Rambeau, and Sersi. For that reason, <em>Avengers 5</em> is a fresh start both for the Avengers team and for the Avengers franchise.</p>\n<h2>2012'S The Avengers Is What Avengers 5 Should Aim At</h2>\n<div style=\"text-align:none;\"><img src=\"https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Avengers-5-leader-doctor-strange-sam-wilson-sersei.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=740&h=370&dpr=1.5\" alt=\"undefined\" style=\"height: undefined;width: undefined\"/></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:none;\"><img src=\"https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/avengers-2012-could-be-a-hit.jpg?q=50&fit=crop&w=740&h=370&dpr=1.5\" alt=\"undefined\" style=\"height: undefined;width: undefined\"/></div>\n<p>If <em>Avengers 5</em> will really play like a new beginning for the Avengers franchise, then <em>The Avengers</em>, and not <em>Endgame</em>, is what the movie should aim at. There are many ways in which The Avengers could have gone wrong, and nothing guaranteed that having six different characters from four different <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/thor-movie-mcu-phase-1-most-important-reason/\" target=\"_self\">Phase 1 MCU movies</a> combined into one story would work. Likewise, it will not be easy for the MCU to pull off an <em>Avengers 5</em> in this moment of transition, especially now that the things like the multiverse and the arrival of the X-Men and the Fantastic Four will compete with the Avengers for the audiences' time and expectation.</p>\n<p>For <em>Avengers 5</em> to succeed in setting up a new generation of Avengers, one that will perdure for the next few years in the MCU, the movie will have to repeat some of <em>The Avengers</em>' most important feats. That includes picking a lineup that works both in front and behind the camera, balancing the screentime so that all of the Avengers can have their moment, and finding a heartful reason for this new group of heroes to truly become a team – which in <em>The Avengers</em> happened thanks to <a href=\"https://screenrant.com/loki-phil-coulson-death-avenged-copy-avengers/\" target=\"_self\">Phil Coulson's death</a>. That is not to say <strong><em>Avengers 5</em></strong> has to copy the same story beats of <em>The Avengers</em> and the Battle of New York, only that the spirit of it will have to be rescued so that a new era for the franchise can begin.</p>\n","PostTitle":"Avengers 5's Real Challenge Is Capturing The Avengers' Magic (Not Beating Endgame)","MetaDescription":null,"Description":"Avengers 5 has the difficult mission of following up Avengers: Endgame, but the film's real challenge is capturing The Avengers' magic","Published":"active","AuthorInfo":{"PK":"ACCT_ujygf9hil43mstls","AccountId":"ujygf9hil43mstls","Avatar":"1655580367367business-man.png","FullName":"Adminis"},"Tags":[{"CreatedDate":"2022-06-10 22:26:52","TagId":"tjygf1xajl48lqhs8","SK":"TAG_tjygf1xajl48lqhs8","PK":"ACCT_ujygf9hil43mstls","Thumbnail":"1654874812791Marvel_Logo.svg.png","TagName":"Marvel"},{"TagName":"Robert Downey Jr.","UpdatedDate":"2022-06-18 00:42:19","CreatedDate":"2022-06-10 22:27:20","TagId":"tjygf1xajl48lr2tg","SK":"TAG_tjygf1xajl48lr2tg","PK":"ACCT_ujygf9hil43mstls","Thumbnail":"1654874840037photo-1652629284797-1652629285007183004729.jpeg"}],"MetaKeyword":null,"UpdatedDate":"2022-06-19 14:49:48","CreatedDate":"2022-06-19 02:28:39","SK":"POST_pjygfwanl4k9w8ry","PK":"ACCT_ujygf9hil43mstls","ReadingTime":"10","PostImage":"1655580519624Screen Shot 2022-06-19 at 02.24.18.png","PublishedDate":"Jul 19 2022"},{"Categories":[{"CategoryId":"cjygf1xajl48l09fy","UpdatedDate":"2022-06-18 00:41:55","CreatedDate":"2022-06-10 22:06:28","SK":"CAT_cjygf1xajl48l09fy","CategoryName":"Tech","PK":"ACCT_ujygf9hil43mstls","Thumbnail":"1654873588906960x0.jpeg"}],"PostID":"pjygfwanl4ka72u2","Thumbnail":"1655581025130Screen Shot 2022-06-19 at 02.33.55.png","Content":"<p style=\"text-align:start;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(51,51,51);font-size: 20px;font-family: Helvetica Neue\", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\">The crypto market suffered one of its most dramatic selloffs in years this week as the prices of top cryptocurrencies declined as much as 35% week-over-week as fears of a broad economic recession intensified.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:start;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(51,51,51);font-size: 20px;font-family: Helvetica Neue\", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\">On Saturday, the total global market cap of cryptocurrencies sank below $850 billion as top tokens tumbled.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:start;\"><span style=\"color: rgb(51,51,51);font-size: 20px;font-family: Helvetica Neue\", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\">Ethereum is trading at half of where it was one month ago, falling below the $1,000 price barrier which it has traded above since January of 2021.
